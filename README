You'll obviously need a Flickr account for this to work.

- In Flickr, create a collection and title it "Work".
- Inside this collection, create sets for each project.
- The titles and descriptions of each set are displayed on the site.
- Put the photos for the project inside each set, making sure that all photos have the same aspect ratio (width divided by height).
- You can also have collections inside the "Work" collection if you want to divide projects into categories.

- Create a set called "Blog". The title and description of each photo in this set then becomes a blog entry overlayed on the photo.
- Create a set called "About". The description of this set is seen in the about section of the site.

- Edit the "config.php" file in this directory to have all the correct settings from Flickr
- Create a "logo.png" that is 500px by 500px and put it in "img" directory (this is optional)
- Upload all the files into a directory on your web host.

ALL DONE!
